5 more minutes! Android application for CS499 by Kyle McNutt and Calvin Chan.

This application, once complete, will allow you to add Groups of Alarms to a list, instead of just individual alarms. This allows you to assoicate groups of Alarms together (ex. "Work", "School"). You will then be able to turn those Alarm Groups on and off instead of just an individual Alarm.
