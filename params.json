An Android application for a better Alarm User Experience by Kyle McNutt and Calvin Chan.\r\n\r\nThis application, once complete, will allow you to add Groups of Alarms to a list, instead of just individual alarms. This allows you to associate groups of Alarms together (ex. \"Work\", \"School\"). You will then be able to turn those Alarm Groups on and off instead of just an individual Alarm.\r\n\r\n[![Get it on Google Play](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KyleMcNutt/5moreminutes/master/Screenshots/AndroidBadge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fivemoreminutes.cs499.cs.csupomona.edu.fivemoreminutes)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
